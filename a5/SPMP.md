If necessary, expand this subsection to lower levels, to accommodate acquisition plans for various types of resources.

## 3.2 Work Plan

### 3.2.1 Work Breakdown Structure

Define a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) to specify the various work activities to be performed in the ICT project, and to depict the relationships among these work activities.

Decompose the work activities to a level that exposes all project risk factors, and that allows accurate estimation of resource requirements and schedule duration for each work activity.

Specify the following factors for each work activity:

- necessary resources,

- estimated duration,

- products or deliverables of the activity,

- acceptance criteria for the work activity products, and

- predecessor and successor work activities.

The level of decomposition internally within the WBS may vary depending on the quality of the requirements, familiarity of the work, applicable level of technology, etc. 

### 3.2.2 Schedule Allocation

Specify the scheduling relationships among the project work activities in a manner that depicts the time-sequencing constraints and illustrates opportunities for concurrent work activities.

Identify the critical path in the schedule.

Indicate any constraints on the scheduling of particular work activities, that are caused by external factors.

Identify appropriate schedule milestones to assess the scope and quality of project work products and of project achievement status.

Techniques for depicting schedule relationships may include milestone charts, activity lists, activity Gantt charts, activity networks, critical path networks and PERT charts. 

### 3.2.3 Resource Allocation

Provide a detailed itemization of the resources allocated to each major work activity in the project WBS.
