## 1. Introduction

## 2. Risk Identification

| **Risk** | **Description** | **Probability** |  **Potential Loss** | **Risk Exposure** | **Risk Category** |
| -------- | --------------- | --------------- | ----------------- | ------------------ | ----------------- |
| Misalignment with Stakeholders | Risk of miscommunication between CRM and stakeholders on project goals and objectives, could result into conflicting priorities and expectations. | 0.25 | 150000 | 37500 | Mission and Goals |
| Inadequate Skilled Resources | 10 developers with less than 5 years of experience could result into delaying the project. | 0.4 | 200000 | 80000 | Organization Management |  
| Regular Changes in Requirements | Regular changes in the requirements and specifications from CRM could potentially impact scope and timeline. | 0.2 | 150000 | 30000 | Customer |  
| Overspending in the Budget | Unexpected expenses like providing more resources to train developer, changes in hardware requirement can possibly exceed budget. | 0.2 | 70000 | 14000 | Budget/Cost |  
|Unsuccessful Marketing | If the marketing plan is ineffective, due to it being led by an inexperienced recent graduate, failing to penetrate the market will result in the need for more funds to be allocated to marketing to raise the public's awareness | 0.5 | 200000| 100000 | Budget/Cost|
| Delays in Resource Availability | Delay in training for CASE tool as AsiaPac being trained last. This could affect the project's schedule and overall progress.  | 0.1 | 90000 | 9000 | Schedule |  
| Management assumptions | Management assuming prototype is doable with in 90 days using the CASE tool could affect the schedule if prototype are not done in the given time-frame.   | 0.6 | 100000 | 60000 | Schedule | 
| Scope Creep | The project's scope expanding without adjustments to the project schedule could delay and increase the cost. | 0.5 | 250000 | 125000 | Schedule |  
| Software Integration | Issues in integrating Software with Hardware could lead to instable system resulting in operational challenges. | 0.6 | 200000 | 120000 | Project Content |  
| High Dependency on Vendors | Heavy reliance on external vendors for critical components could cause delays or issues outside the project scope. | 0.3 | 100000 | 30000 | Project Content |
| Scalability and Performance | The high variance in test number and real world data which also varies significantly by hour, day and season could lead to system not performing optimally. | 0.3 | 150000 | 45000 | Performance |  
|Reservation Overload| The growing amount of users will imply greater number of reservations. This could overall effect system performance if there are too many reservations (>25,000 per day) being made at one time.| 0.4| 400000 | 160000 | Performance |
| Inexperience in Foreign Project Management | The PM has never worked on an international project before. This could then lead to miscommunication/misunderstanding between the PM and the team when managing foreign teammates. | 0.2 | 100000 | 20000 | Project Management |
| Loss of Product Quality due to Poor Communication | Analyses of alternatives and quality assurance can be lost in translation when developing the software, leading to poor product quality. | 0.4 | 200000 | 80000 | Development Risk |
|Distance between Team Members | Some of the team will be in China. Teams need face-to-face contact on a regular basis. This will degrade time efficiency and quality of the project if there are no regular meetings of the entire team. | 0.5 | 300000 | 150000 | Development Environment |
|Deficiency in CRM's Hardware and Software | The development tools and platforms provided by CRM may not be sufficiently built for the needs of the project. This can lead to a reduction in possible features and development efficiency. | 0.3 | 600000 | 180000 | Development Environment |
| Management Team in Foreign Environment | The four-person management team will be relocated to China for the project. This will force the management team to use interpreters for communication overall reducing the efficacy of communication and loss of team coalition. This can then reduce project efficiency and quality| 0.5 | 350000 | 175000 | Development Environment |
|Many Inexperienced Programmers | Around 38% of the team have a lack of experience. This can reduce productivity by 10-25 times relative to a fully experienced team of programmers| 0.6|500000|300000|Staff|
|Staff has a Lack of Knowledge in Object Orientation | None of the personnel at CRM have experience developing OO systems. This inexperience can reduce productivity with the needed time to learn OO systems. |0.25 | 200000 | 50000 | Staff |
|Quality of Support | The team has an unverified quality of communication. This may cause an inability to communicate problems, thus reducing quality of customer support and the project's efficiency | 0.4 | 200000 |80000 | Maintenance |
