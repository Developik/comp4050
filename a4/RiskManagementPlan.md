| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ----------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Misalignment with Stakeholders  | Risk of miscommunication between CRM and stakeholders on project goals and objectives, could result into confilicting priorities and expectations.              | 0.25            | 150000            | 37500              | Mission and Goals       |
| Inadequate Skilled Resources    | 10 developers with less than 5 years of experience could result into dealying the project.                                                                      | 0.4             | 200000            | 80000              | Organization Management |
| Regular Changes in Requirements | Regular changes in the requirments and specifications from CRM could potentially impact scope and timeline.                                                     | 0.2             | 150000            | 30000              | Customer                |
| Overspeding in the Budget       | Unexpected expenses like providing more resources to train devloper, changes in hardware requirment can possibly exceed budget.                                 | 0.2             | 70000             | 14000              | Budget/Cost             |
| Delays in Resource Availability | Delay in tranning for CASE tool as AsiaPac being tranied last. This could affect the project's schedule and overall progress.                                   | 0.1             | 90000             | 9000               | Schedule                |
| Management asumptions           | Management assuming prototype is doable with in 90 days using the CASE tool could affect the schedule if prototype are not done in the given timeframe.         | 0.6             | 100000            | 60000              | Schedule                |
| Scope Creep                     | The project's scope expanding without adjustments to the project schedule could delay and increase the cost.                                                    | 0.5             | 250000            | 125000             | Schedule                |
| Software Integration            | Isuues in integrating Software with Hardware could lead to instable system resulting in operational challenges.                                                 | 0.6             | 200000            | 120000             | Project Content         |
| High Dependency on Vendors      | Heavy reliance on external vendors for critical components could cause delays or issues outside the poject scope.                                               | 0.3             | 100000            | 30000              | Project Content         |
| Scalability and Performance     | The high variance in test number and real world data which is also varires significantly by hour, day and season could lead to system not perfroming optimally. | 0.3             | 150000            | 45000              | Project Content         |

## 3. Key Risk Identification

This section identifies the key risks for this project. The risks are prioritised based on the highest risk exposure from the table above.

1. Many Inexperienced Programmers.

2. Deficiency in CRM's Hardware and Software.

3. Management Team in Foreign Environment.

4. Reservation Overload.

5. Distance between Team Members.

### 3.1 Justification

- **Many Inexperienced Programmers**:  
  Inexperienced development team may take much longer to complete tasks, resulting in delays and potentially compromised project quality. Due to the significant impact inexperienced programmers can have on project productivity, this risk is ranked at the top.

- **Deficiency in CRM's Hardware and Software**:  
  Inadequate tools and platforms can result in slower development processes, scalability challenges, and potential budget overruns, impacting both project timeline and quality. To ensure the project succeeds, addressing this risk requires a proactive assessment of existing resources and necessary upgrades. Hence this risk is prioritised.

- **Management Team in Foreign Environment**:  
  The management team's presence in a foreign setting creates possible misalignment and communication issues. This risk is significant since it could affect team cohesiveness, decision-making, and the effectiveness of the project as a whole.

- **Reservation Overload**:  
  If the system cannot handle a high volume of reservations, it could result in poor user experience, potential system crashes, and increased customer dissatisfaction. This makes it a critical risk as it directly affects the system's performance.

- **Distance between Team Members**:  
  The geographical separation of team members, especially when some are located in China, can lead to communication and collaboration difficulties. This can impact the project's efficiency and the quality of work delivered.
