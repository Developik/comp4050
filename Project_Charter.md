## **PURPOSE OF PROJECT CHARTER**

_[Provide the purpose of the project charter.]_

The _\<Project Name\>_ project charter documents and tracks the necessary information required by decision maker(s) to approve the project for funding. The project charter should include the needs, scope, justification, and resource commitment as well as the project's sponsor(s) decision to proceed or not to proceed with the project. It is created during the Initiating Phase of the project.

The intended audience of the _\<Project Name\>_ project charter is the project sponsor and senior leadership.

# **PROJECT AND PRODUCT OVERVIEW**

_[Typically, the description should answer who, what, when and where, in a concise manner. It should also state the estimated project duration (e.g., 18 months) and the estimated project budget (e.g., $1.5M)._
