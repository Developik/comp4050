# INTRODUCTION

  1.
## PURPOSE OF PROJECT CHARTER

_[Provide the purpose of the project charter.]_

The _\<Project Name\>_ project charter documents and tracks the necessary information required by decision maker(s) to approve the project for funding. The project charter should include the needs, scope, justification, and resource commitment as well as the project's sponsor(s) decision to proceed or not to proceed with the project. It is created during the Initiating Phase of the project.

The intended audience of the _\<Project Name\>_ project charter is the project sponsor and senior leadership.

1.
# PROJECT AND PRODUCT OVERVIEW

_[Typically, the description should answer who, what, when and where, in a concise manner. It should also state the estimated project duration (e.g., 18 months) and the estimated project budget (e.g., $1.5M)._

1.
# JUSTIFICATION

  1.
## OBJECTIVES

[_identify the objectives using_ _**SMART (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, Time-bound)**_]

The objectives of the _\<Project Name\>_ are as follows:

- _[Insert Objective 1]_
- _[Insert Objective 2]_
- _[Add additional bullets as necessary]_

## EXECUTIVE MILESTONES

_[Example: For CPIC major/tactical projects, these milestones could be used to complete the Funding Plan/Cost and Schedule section of the OMB Exhibit 300.]_

The table below lists the high-level Executive Milestones of the project and their estimated completion timeframe.

| **Executive Milestones** | **Estimated Completion Timeframe** |
| --- | --- |
| _[Insert milestone information (e.g., Project planned and authorized to proceed)]_ | _[Insert completion timeframe (e.g., Two weeks after project concept is approved)]_ |
| --- | --- |
| _[Insert milestone information (e.g., Version 1 completed)]_ | _[Insert completion timeframe (e.g., Twenty-five weeks after requirements analysis is completed)]_ |
| _[Add additional rows as necessary]_ |

# ASSUMPTIONS, CONSTRAINTS AND RISKS

  1.
## ASSUMPTIONS

_[Example: The system is being developed to capture data from public health partners. One assumption is that data is entered electronically into the system.]_

This section identifies the statements believed to be true and from which a conclusion was drawn to define this project charter.

1. _Users of the online virtual phone system are expected to have access to dependable internet and cloud services in order to place and receive calls._
2. _The billing software must correctly determine prices depending on call length, time of day, and calling plan. A crucial restriction is ensuring accuracy in billing calculations._
3.

  1.
## CONSTRAINTS

_[Example: There might be time constraints on developing a system that is used to track data of highly infectious diseases like SARS.]_

This section identifies any limitation that must be taken into consideration prior to the initiation of the project.

1. The system needs to make sure that no phone numbers can start with a particular prefix that is used for advanced features. The available phone numbers are constrained by this restriction, which should be taken into account while designing the dialing plan.
2. The billing software must correctly determine prices depending on call length, time of day, and calling plan. A crucial restriction is ensuring accuracy in billing calculations.

  1.
## RISKS

_[Example: The risk of accessibility or unavailability of public health partners for obtaining requirements to develop a data collection system may delay project deliverables. A possible mitigation strategy might be to schedule requirement sessions with the partners as early as possible. List the risks that the project sponsor should be aware of before making a decision on funding the project, including risks of not funding the project.]_

| **Risk** | **Mitigation** |
| --- | --- |
| The possibility of poor internet connectivity or cloud service disruptions could impair users' capacity to communicate by interfering with their ability to make and receive calls through the system. | Implement redundancies or backup communication systems to reduce the likelihood of service outages. |
| --- | --- |
| Errors in billing or conflicts with users run the danger of causing financial losses or client dispair. | Implement thorough testing and validation of the billing system to reduce errors and develop a transparent procedure for handling disputes. |
